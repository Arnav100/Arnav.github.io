                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    To have the Robot perform actions, we create commands using the subsystems 
                    and sensors we have created. Each command extends the FRC created 
                    abstract class, Command. The necessary methods to override are: 
                    <code>initialize() execute() isFinished() end() interrupted()</code> and the 
                    constructor is also important. Most commands are simple, I will walk through how
                    to make an Intake command.
                </p>
                <h3 class = "mt-5">Constructor</h3>
                <p class = "info lead">
                    The constructor of a command is like any other constructor for a class, 
                    it should take in any necessary infomation for the command to run (E.X.
                    amount of time to run). But, an important part of the constructor for commands
                    is that it should call the method requires() method which intakes a subsystem that
                    this command is going to use. Example: <br><br>
                    <code>
                        private double runTime; <br>
                        public Intake(double runTime) { <br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp this.runTime = runTime;<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp requires(Robot.gripper);<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">initialize()</h3>
                <p class = "info lead">
                    The initialize method only runs once and should set any sensors or
                    robot state info to the values they should be at the start of the method. 
                    Example: <br><br>
                    <code>
                        @Override <br>
                        protected void initialize() { <br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Robot.isIntaking = true; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">execute()</h3>
                <p class = "info lead">
                    The execute method runs repeatedly with the robot, every 20 milliseconds 
                    to be precise, and should contain the code for what the robot should be doing,
                    using the methods we write for that subsystem. Example: <br><br>
                    <code>
                        @Override <br>
                        protected void execute() { <br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Robot.gripper.intake(); <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">isFinished()</h3>
                <p class = "info lead">
                    The isFinished method also runs repeatedly and returns a boolean, true if 
                    the command should stop, false otherwise. Commands which are supposed to 
                    run while a button is held down, should return false so that they continue. 
                    Autonomous commands and commands which are expected to run after a click of a button
                    should return some kind of boolean which changes based of time or a sensor. If a command
                    is meant to only run once, it should isFinished should simply return true. In this intake 
                    command, it should finish when either the runTime is complete or perhaps when a limitswitch 
                    tells us the gripper has a ball. The method <code>timeSinceInitalized()</code> is a built in method 
                    in the Command class which returns how long it has been since the initalize() method was called.
                    Example: <br><br>
                    <code>
                                            @Override <br>
                                            protected boolean isFinished() { <br>
                                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return timeSinceInitalized() > this.runTime || Robot.limitSwitches.isBallIn(); <br>
                                            }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">end()</h3>
                <p class = "info lead">
                    The end method runs once and is called directly after isFinished() returns false. 
                    This method should do whats needed to stop the command, such as stopping
                    motors or subsystems, and change any needed Robot states. Example: <br><br>
                    <code>
                        @Override <br>
                        protected void end() { <br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Robot.gripper.stop(); <br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Robot.isIntaking = false; <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">interrupted()</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    The interrupted method runs if cancel() is called on the command or
                    another command is called which requires the same subsystem as the current.
                    The code for this method should be the exact same for every single command of ours,
                    it should simply call end(). Example: <br><br>
                    <code>
                        @Override <br>
                        protected void interrupted() { <br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end(); <br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
