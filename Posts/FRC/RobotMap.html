                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    Every Robot has lots of Talons, sensors, and other attachments, and each live
                    somewhere in the body of the robot; in the code, these objects live in RobotMap. 
                    Each device connected to the robot should be declared as a public static class 
                    variable of RobotMap, and must be instantiated and settings configured within 
                    the <code>init()</code> method. These objects will then be used to greater subsystem
                    and sensor classes to control the robot.
                </p>
                <h3 class = "mt-5">WPI_TalonSRX</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    Talons are speed controllers each connected to a Robot's motor so that we can 
                    program its movement. We rarely have used Victors, but if we do, the code for
                    those is relatively the same. As of 2019, in order to program these Talons in 
                    Visual Studio Code, you need to run the WPILib: Manage Vendor Libraries command,
                    and install a new library online with this  
                    <a href = "http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/Phoenix-latest.json">link</a>.
                    More info for the talon software and the talon tuner can be found  
                    <a href = "http://www.ctr-electronics.com/talon-srx.html">here</a>. The tuner program is especially important
                    because it is used to give each talon a specific numerical ID, which will then be used 
                    in our code to instantiate the talon. Start each talon ID from 20 upwards, and whenever you change
                    the name or ID of a talon in the tuner, perform a test blink to verify you changed what you were expecting. 
                    Apart from instantiation, the configuration of each talon object involves reversing necessary 
                    motors, setting slaves and masters, setting encoders, and reversing encoders. Each of these methods
                    can be found in the CTRE Documentation. 
                </p>
                <h3 class = "mt-5">Pneumatics</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    The Pneumatics configuration is very simple and should be done in RobotMap. To
                    make the compressor active and stop when necessary, simply instantiating it will
                    allow it do that (Defualt ID is 50). Each solenoid should also be instantiated and
                    put in the state that the robot should be in when it starts up.
                </p>
                <h3 class = "mt-5">Sensors</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    Sensors including but not limited to, gyros, ultasonics, limit switches and potentiometers
                    should also be instantiated in init(). The NAVX library (Gyro sensor) needs to also be added
                    the same way as the Talons, but with this  
                    <a href = "https://www.kauailabs.com/dist/frc/2019/navx_frc.json">link</a> instead.
