                <p class="info lead">
                    In order to understand to control the different states and locations
                    of the robot as it goes through gameplay, we use sensors to monitor it. 
                    The methods necessary to use the sensors will be provided by their libraries,
                    but we make our own classes for them to better fit our needs. Like Subsystems, 
                    each of these classes should be declared as static variables within the
                    Robot class, and instantiated within RobotInit(). Sensors we have 
                    used in the past include limitswitches, potentiometers, gyroscopes, ultrasonics, 
                    and encoders
                </p>
                <h3 class = "mt-5">Limitswitches</h3>
                <div class = "row">
                    <div class = "col-md-8">
                        <p class = "info lead">
                            A limitswitch is basically a button. Its output will either be true or false,
                            depending on whether or not it is pushed. We generally will have multiple 
                            limitswitches on a robot (E.X. one to determine if a gripper has a ball and
                            one to determine if robot arm is all the way down) and after making each sensor in 
                            RobotMap, we can create a seperate LimitSwitch class in the sensors package which 
                            has methods specific to the purpose to the limitswitches (E.X. isBallIn(), isArmDown()).
                            This way we only need to call one object, an instance of our LimitSwitch class, to determine
                            the states of the robot.

                            We use a sensor called the NavX which is basically a gyroscope. The library for
                            this sensor needs to be added to the project (Instructions can be found in my description 
                            of <a href = "RobotMap.html">RobotMap</a>). The given class for the sensor is called AHRS,
                            but we create our own class called NavX using the AHRS object instantiated in RobotMap. 
                            Depending on the orientation of the NavX on the robot, getting the angle which the
                            robot is directed at may be either be from the getPitch(), getYaw(), or getRoll() method. After
                            determing which method we want to use, we can create a method call getAngle() in our NavX 
                            class which just returns the desired value. <br>
                            For Example, if the NavX was on the robot in such a way that getYaw() was returning the angle 
                            the robot would face after turning, our code in the NavX class would be:
                            <br><br>
                            <code>
                                public double getAngle() { <br>
                                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn RobotMap.ahrs.getYaw(); <br>
                                } <br><br>
                            </code>
                            Due to this, we don't have to remember which method to use and just call getAngle() on an instance of our
                            NavX class. 
                            <br> <br>
                            One thing to note, the NavX may not be giving proper values at first try, before testing, be sure to
                            follow the instructions 
                            <a href = "https://pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/guidance/gyroaccelcalibration/">here</a> under the 
                            Factory Calibration instructions. 
                        </p>

                            For encoders, it is not totally necessary to create a seperate class
                            specifally for them because they are generally attached to Talons and the
                            WPI_TalonSRX class has methods to directly get each talon's encoder value. 
                            For example, in RobotMap, to configure an encoder on the left front wheel, the
                            code would be: <br><br>
                            <code>lFrontDrive.configSelectedFeedbackSensor(FeedbackDevice.QuadEncoder,0,100);</code>
                            <br><br>
                            And then whenever the encoder value of that particular talon would be necessary, the code
                            would be: <br><br>
                            <code>RobotMap.lFrontDrive.getSelectedSensorPosition(0)</code>
                            <br><br>
                            Another important method is reseting the encoder value:<br><br>
                            <code>RobotMap.lFrontDrive.setSelectedSensorPosition(0);</code>
                        </p>
