                            The procedure described in this post is to make a robot's drivetrain change in speed by following
                            a sigmoid function. In previous years, we would simply pass in the the joystick value as the speed 
                            for the drivetrain to move at. An issue that can occur through this is that if the driver is going full
                            speed forward and then decides to suddenly go full speed backwards the sudden change can cause motors or gears
                            to break or get damaged (Figure 1). Our first attempts to change this was to use PID loops to smooth the transition,
                            but the issue we saw with PID loops is that we had no proper way to predict a graph of the change based on the PID values 
                            prior to driving the robot,
                            and the graphs we got after driving the robots did not display the speed change we hoped for (Figure 2 is similar to what we saw). 
                            Our programming mentor suggested we program the drivetrain to follow a sigmoid curve and after viewing the curve, we saw that 
                            it was the best solution to our problem (Figure 3).

                <p class="info lead">
                    For our sigmoid equation for speed which the robot has to follow, the range of that equation should be 
                    from -1 to 1. The normal sigmoid function y =  1/(1 + e^(-x)) has a range of 0 to 1, so with adjustments to meet our need,
                    we can use the equation y = 2 /(1 + e^(-x * A)) - 1, where A is a variable we can change to adjust the acceleration between
                    the values -1 and 1.

                    Another important equation for this procedure is the inverse of our sigmoid equation. This is needed because since the speed of
                    the robot will be changing as it progresses along the sigmoid equation, the inverse equation can let us know the X value (time) 
                    the current speed was just at. To determine the inverse of any equation, the y and x values should be switched and then simplifed
                    to the form y = ___ . The inverse of the sigmoid equation is, y = -ln((2 / (x + 1)) - 1) / A

                    The procedure our team created relies on the fact that the roborio loops the code roughly every 200 milliseconds. So using this fact
                    we can have the robot speed progress along the sigmoid equation to the speed inputted by the joystick.

                    Two int arrays of length 2 are kept as instance variables within the drivetrain class to keep track of the robot's speeds. 
                    The reason each of these arrays are of length 2 is because the left and right side of the robot move at different speeds in order
                    to make turns. If necessary, you could have each wheel move at different speeds and have the length of each array be equal to the number
                    of wheels, but that would be a rare scenario. 
                    These arrays are labeled desiredSpeeds and currentSpeeds, the former holds the speeds being inputted by the joysticks (the desired values),
                    and the latter holds the real speeds of the drivetrain as it progresses through the equation.

                <p class = "info lead">
                    As stated earlier, the A value can be set to any number to increase the acceleration between the values -1 and 1. For testing this
                    code to make sure it performs as expected, I would suggest using A values between 2 - 5, because the wheel changing speed to match the joystick
                    values will be most visual. For our team, we let our mechanical mentor adjust the A value himself and he settled on the value of 25. With this high value,
                    the wheel speed adjustment is quick and barely noticiable but still there, thereby stopping any motors from breaking from sudden changes. I would
                    not reccommend using very high values because then it will take the robot too long to perform the calculations for the equations. For gameplay,
                    our value of 25 worked very well, and we used lower values to have the robot accelerate and decelerate during autonomous. A benefit to using this
                    procedure rather than PID loops is that you can graph the sigmoid equation, using sites like <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f6n5lffiwd">Desmos</a>,
                    and find what kind of acceleration you would like.

                    Our use of this procedure resulted in no gear breaking problems from sudden changes
                    during the 2019 season, so we can label this as a success. With this procedure, not just a sigmoid equation but
                    <b>any function can be used</b> to control the robot speed. As long as the inverse function can be written, the sigmoid function 
                    can be replaced.

                    Initially this year, we wanted to create
                    a 100% custom drivetrain class, without using the FRC provided DifferentialDrive library. Our reasoning behind
                    this was so that we could have each one of our six wheels move independent of any other and
                    have traction control if one wheel spun out. We didn't end up doing this because when trying to use even a normal drive
                    movement
                    by sending power to the wheels, we would get slight jittery movement, regardless of our attempts. Also, the traction
                    control wasn't
                    viewed as a necessary ability by our programming mentor, so we decided to pick up that idea another time. Possibly in
                    the future
                    we will go back and try again to do these things.
