                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    In order to program a Robot, we look at smaller components working together
                    for specific tasks and program them, these are called subsystems. Together, 
                    by programming all the Robot's subsystems, we are able to control the whole
                    Robot. This Subsystem package is meant to contain classes which extend
                    the abstract Subsystem class.
                </p>

                <h3 class = "mt-5">Override Methods</h3>
                <p class = "info lead">
                    The only abstract method of the Subsystem class is 
                    <code>public void initDefaultCommand()</code> The code for this method is to
                    call <code>setDefaultCommand(/*new Command()*/)</code> This allows for a command
                    to be continuously called by the Subsystem. For example, the Drive command
                    for a Drive Train which runs off joystick control should be the defualt command
                    of the Drive Train subsystem because it needs to be called continuously. Not 
                    all subsystems need a defualt command, for example a gripper may not need to be
                    doing anything continuously, so we can just leave the code for the
                    initDefaultCommand method blank. 
                </p>
                <h3 class = "mt-5">Subsystem Examples</h3>
                <p class = "info lead">
                    There is a variety of possible subsystems which can be used on a robot, and
                    there will always be more since each year's game is so different than previous games. 
                    Susbsystems we have used in the past are the Drive Train, ball gripper, elevator, arm,
                    dropwheel, jumpjacks (pistons in back which drop the wheels) and many more. In order
                    to determine what should be a subsystem, it is best to communicate with the mechanical 
                    team to determine which mechanisms should work together and which seperately.
