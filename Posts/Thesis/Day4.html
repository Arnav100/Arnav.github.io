                <p class="info lead">
                   Up to this point I have been able to have Jonbot signal the arduino to start a lidar scan 
                   and then have the arduino send back the data. I realized this data was not actually being fully sent
                   as information was lost in the conversion to bytes that were sent to the robot. The goal for 
                   today was to have the full data be sent to the robot and then to clean up the arduino's code.
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Progress</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    After thinkng through how to send the lidar readings to Jonbot without losing any information, I 
                    realized after looking through the Arduino Wire library documentation, the .write() method could take
                    in a string as a parameter. So I simply changed my code so that instead of creating a byte array with the 
                    data, it would concatenate each value to a String and seperate each value with a space. When I tried compiling
                    this code, I recieved an error trying to pass the String I created as the input for the .write() method. 
                    After some research, I realized that in the Arduino C++, String and string are different classes. The String (uppercase) 
                    class is a part of the built in Arduino library which behaves similarily as the String class in Java. The string (lowercase) 
                    class is a part of C++ and is essentially a char array. The fix to my error was simple, I just created a storage 
                    char array and used the Arduino String class method .toCharArray() to fill the storage array with the contents
                    of the String and used the char array as the input to the .write() method. Then in Jonbot's code, 
                    I edited the ArduinoRead command I had made to parse through the byte array to convert values seperated by a space char
                    into ints, and then sent that array to be stored in the ArrayList of int arrays I was using previously. This 
                    procedure worked and I was able to view the full readings of the lidar on Jonbot's Driverstation terminal.

                <h3 class="mt-5">Arduino Side Improvements</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    I decided to improve upon the Aruino's code now that everything was working. The code was currently
                    inputting the angle, distance, and strength values into the fullSendData array in the printCollectedData() method,
                    taking each value from their storage array. Instead, I edited the procedure so that the data would would 
                    be placed in the fullSendData directly within gatherSensorReading(), removing the need for the three seperate
                    storage arrays. This fixed some performance and memory issues the arduino was experiencing, resulting in faster data collection. 
                    I then rearranged the progression of states the arduino would go through so that the adjusting and verifying
                    of the lidar settings would happen first, without any signal, and then the arduino would wait for Jonbot's signal. Lastly, 
                    since the code was currently only collecting and sending one scan at a time to Jonbot, I changed the code so that once lastIndexSent 
                    was greater than 500 (the array's length), the storage variables would reset and it would collect and send another scan. This process would stop
                    only when the arudino recived a value of 2 from Jonbot. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Jonbot Side Improvements</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    Rather than using an int[] to store each scan point, I created a class called ScanPacket which stores 
                    the angle, distance, and strength as private instance variables and has getter methods for each along with an 
                    overriden toString() method and an isEmpty() method which returns true if all values are 0. Also, a class called 
                    Scan was created which contains an ArrayList of ScanPackets. Since the arudino uses an array of length 500 to hold the 
                    values of one scan to send to the robot, there exist some leftover indexes within this array which remain 0. Prior to creating 
                    the Scan and ScanPacket class, I was ommiting int arrays containing only zeroes to be added to the storage ArrayList. The Scan
                    class contains the method addScanPacket() which adds an empty (only containing zeores) packet if the previously added packet was not empty. 
                    This empty packet marks the end of a 360 scan. Also, a new command was created which toggles the value to be sent to the Arduino
                    as either 1 or 2. 1 signals the arduino to begin a lidar scan, 2 signals a stop. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="mt-5">Future Work</h3>
                <p class="info lead">
                    Now that Jonbot is recieving continous and multiple lidar scans, I want to create an interface to visualize the data. 
                    After looking into how to create a custom Smart Dashboard application, I came across
                     <a href = "https://github.com/FRCDashboard/FRCDashboard">Team 1418's FRC Dashboard application</a>, which allows anyone to 
                    create their own dashboard by editing their code. I plan to use this to create my own interface. Since this may take some time, 
                    another test I plan on performing is to use the lidar to determine the angle of the location farthest away from the robot, and have 
                    it turn and move towards that area. With all this complete, I will plan out more use for the lidar's readings.
