                    Hi, I am Arnav Parashar, a student at Nichols School class of '20. I love learning and 
                    applying various areas of computer programming. I created this website as both an exercise 
                    in my pursuit of programming knowledge and to document what I have learned for the use of 
                    others. As much as I've come to love learning the subject, over this past year, I've also realized
                    I enjoy teaching programming just as much. I am the programming captain in my school's FRC team,
                    Electric Mayhem 4930, and at the start of the season, I created a mini curriculum to teach our six
                    new programmers java and how to program a robot, resulting in each of them being able to help program our 2019
                    FRC Robot. Since then, I wanted to continue teaching others and have worked a part-time summer job
                    at a center called Robothink where I teach how to build and program small robots to young children. 
                </p>
                <p class = "info">
                    On this website, I plan to write up a guide on how my team programs an FRC robot, to leave as a resource
                    for future 4930 programmers and others within FRC. I also aim to document the work done on my senior thesis,
                    a lidar controlled robot, along with some of my past projects like the 
                    <a href = "https://matchscouting.web.app/index.html">2019 FRC scouting app </a> I created for my team 
                    and my team's <a href = "https://robotics.nicholsschool.org/">website/blog</a>.  
                    If this website can help anyone with an issue they have or inspire them to take on a similar project
                    to mine, that would be awesome. I am nowhere near an expert on programming and
                    this website is really just me documenting my work and thought process as I learn new things,
                    so of course there may be a better solution to what I come up with in my projects
                    ( And if you'd like to inform me, I'd love to know about it). Feel free to ask questions, offer advice,
                    or ask me to work on a project for you.
